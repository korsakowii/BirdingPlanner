As the first light painted the sky, I found myself standing in New York, 
binoculars in hand and hope in heart. The morning chorus was just beginning, and I was 
searching for Blue Jay (AI Tier T5, Confidence: 95.0%).

The distinctive call of the Blue Jay echoed through New York, and moments later, I spotted 
it perched majestically on a low branch. The AI-enhanced identification confirmed this was 
indeed our target species, with optimal viewing conditions.

The Blue Jay may be common to some, but to me, each sighting is unique and precious.
