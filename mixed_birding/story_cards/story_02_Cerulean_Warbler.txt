As the first light painted the sky, I found myself standing in New York, binoculars in hand and hope in heart. The morning chorus was just beginning, and I was searching for Cerulean Warbler.

The distinctive call of the Cerulean Warbler echoed through New York, and moments later, I spotted it perched majestically on a low branch.

As I observed the Cerulean Warbler in New York, I felt a deep connection to the natural world, a reminder of the beauty that surrounds us.
