==================================================

As the first light painted the sky, I found myself standing in New York, binoculars in hand and hope in heart. The morning chorus was just beginning, and I was searching for American Robin.

After hours of patient waiting, my persistence paid off when the American Robin finally revealed itself in New York, a moment I'll never forget.

Watching the American Robin in New York reminded me why I love birding - every encounter tells a story, every moment is a gift from nature.
