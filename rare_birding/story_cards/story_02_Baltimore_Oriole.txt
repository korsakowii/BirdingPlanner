==================================================

The crisp morning air carried the promise of new discoveries as I ventured into New York. My target today was the elusive Baltimore Oriole, a bird I had been hoping to encounter.

The distinctive call of the Baltimore Oriole echoed through New York, and moments later, I spotted it perched majestically on a low branch.

The Baltimore Oriole may be common to some, but to me, each sighting is unique and precious. It's these simple connections that keep me coming back to New York.
