As the first light painted the sky, I found myself standing in New York, binoculars in hand and hope in heart. The morning chorus was just beginning, and I was searching for Golden-winged Warbler.

After hours of patient waiting, my persistence paid off when the Golden-winged Warbler finally revealed itself in New York, a moment I'll never forget.
