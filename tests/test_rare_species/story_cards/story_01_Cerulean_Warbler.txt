==================================================

With camera ready and field guide in hand, I set out in New York with one goal: to find and observe the Cerulean Warbler in its natural habitat.

Suddenly, there it was! The Cerulean Warbler appeared before me in New York, its vibrant colors catching the morning light perfectly.
