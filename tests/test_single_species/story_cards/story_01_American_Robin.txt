==================================================

As the first light painted the sky, I found myself standing in New York, binoculars in hand and hope in heart. The morning chorus was just beginning, and I was searching for American Robin.

Suddenly, there it was! The American Robin appeared before me in New York, its vibrant colors catching the morning light perfectly.

The American Robin may be common to some, but to me, each sighting is unique and precious. It's these simple connections that keep me coming back to New York.
