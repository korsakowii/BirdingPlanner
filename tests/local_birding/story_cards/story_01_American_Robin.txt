==================================================

With camera ready and field guide in hand, I set out in New York with one goal: to find and observe the American Robin in its natural habitat.

After hours of patient waiting, my persistence paid off when the American Robin finally revealed itself in New York, a moment I'll never forget.

Watching the American Robin in New York reminded me why I love birding - every encounter tells a story, every moment is a gift from nature.
