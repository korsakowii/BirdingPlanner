==================================================

With camera ready and field guide in hand, I set out in New York with one goal: to find and observe the Blue Jay in its natural habitat.

The distinctive call of the Blue Jay echoed through New York, and moments later, I spotted it perched majestically on a low branch.

The Blue Jay may be common to some, but to me, each sighting is unique and precious. It's these simple connections that keep me coming back to New York.
