==================================================

With camera ready and field guide in hand, I set out in New York with one goal: to find and observe the American Robin in its natural habitat.

The distinctive call of the American Robin echoed through New York, and moments later, I spotted it perched majestically on a low branch.

Watching the American Robin in New York reminded me why I love birding - every encounter tells a story, every moment is a gift from nature.
